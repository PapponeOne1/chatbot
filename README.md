# Chatbot Project

A simple learning chatbot that interacts with users and learns new responses based on user inputs. The bot starts with no predefined knowledge and builds its memory entirely from user interactions.

## How It Works
- The chatbot processes user input and tries to match it with stored responses.
- If it finds a match, it responds with the learned answer.
- If no match is found, it asks the user to provide the expected response and memorizes it for future conversations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
